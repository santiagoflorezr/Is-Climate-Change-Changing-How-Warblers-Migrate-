<h2>Is Climate Change Changing How Warblers Migrate? </h4>
<h4> <i>Comparing century-old data with recent observations of Blackburnian warblers in North America shows changes in spring and fall migration for these birds; but the answer it's complicated. </i></h4>

In 1907 Frank Chapman (1864-1955), who proposed the Christmas Bird Count and the first curator of ornithology at the American Museum of Natural History, published the book The Warblers of North America which contains data on the migration of these birds from a century ago.

<p>
There is evidence that global warming is changing how birds migrate; <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/millions-of-birds-are-migrating-earlier-because-of-warming/">  in 2019 a team used satellite data to conclude that bird migration is changing due to climate change.</a> By comparing Chapman data with data from eBird, an online database of bird observation and one of the biggest citizen science projects in the world, can we find evidence of changes in bird migration?
  </p>

<p>
  To answer this question I compared the arrival and departure dates of Blackburnian warblers in North America using both Chapman book and data from eBird. I compared a seven year average of dates using data from eBird with Chapman data, and compared the cities that Chapman mentions with current data from the counties where they are located.

</p>
<p>
  The comparison shows that there are significant changes in the migration of Blackburnian warblers. Although in places such as Atlanta and New Orleans the average arrival date was very similar; in higher latitudes like New York and Nova Scotia (Pictou), birds are arriving, on average, more than a week later than a century ago. Changes seem to be more extreme in fall; where the average departure date changed in most locations by several weeks.

<h4> Climate change or bias in the data?</h4>

<p>
  When daylight changes there are hormonal changes in these birds that get them ready to migrate. However, according to Musher birds are are “picking up cues from the environment around them. If they can’t get enough food to fly they are not going to fly, if it's too cold they are going to burn more calories than they can store.”
</p>

<p>
  “This is good evidence that things are changing… it is not the smoking gun, but is evidence,” said Lukas Musher a evolutionary biologist/ornithologist and a Postdoc at the Academy of Sciences of Drexel University.
</p>
<p>
  Changes in daylight determine hormonal changes in these birds that get them ready for migration. However, birds are also “picking up cues from the environment around them. If they can’t get enough food to fly they are not going to fly, if it's too cold they are going to burn more calories than they can store” added Musher.
</p>

<p>
  Could an explanation for the changes in migration be that warmer temperatures are creating the conditions to change Blackburnian warblers migrations patterns? Could we assume that with warmer temperatures in places like Atlanta, there are more insects for birds to eat and fly sooner up north?
</p>

<p>
  Before coming to any conclusion it is important to remember that these two data sets were collected in very different ways and contexts. Frank Chapman had 36 collaborators, all wealthy male naturalists; on the other hand eBird has thousands of observers from all around the world. For example, in 2020 there were 103,688 Blackburnian warbler observations in 23 different countries reported on the platform.
</p>

<p>
  It is important also to consider the bias in the data. First there is sampling bias, “birdwatchers are going to the places they know they are going to find birds at, they're not using some algorithm to randomly generate coordinates.” explained Musher. Second, both sets have a bias towards fall migration. Chapman presents a lot less data from this season, and for many warblers he does not present any data at all. Musher explains that from a birder perspective it is harder to identify these birds during fall, usually during these months “there are fewer records. Birds aren't singing in the fall, which means they are not detected at the same frequency, and they are harder to identify just by looking at them…. in September and October female Blackburniar warblers look very similar to other female warblers.”
</p>

<p>
  According to Musher big data birds such as ebird there are always concerns about the quality (eg: who is observing, how rigorous and trustworthy), however he is an advocate for the platform “benefits outweigh the drawbacks; it is just rally amazing all the data that eBird is accumulating, every minute, every day, across the world.”

  Coda: While writing this story Musher made me aware of a Blackburnian warbler observation <a href="https://ebird.org/atlasny/checklist/S97268667?view=photos">recorded on November 2 2021 in Suffolk County in Long Island</a> record for this species.
